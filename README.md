## Warmup Assignment II - SortedVector

See the specification for this OPTIONAL assignment in the companion pdf document. Implement the functionality
specified therein and be sure to follow all the submission directions.


You should update this README (rather than deleting it). It serves as a first stop for whomever is about to 
look at your project and provides them with guidance; it gives you the opportunity to curate the reader's 
initial experience in whatever manner you choose.


To be able to run your program, open and edit the makefile (in a non-RTF text editing program, such as Sublime Text) and provide the appropriate sources to compile along with the executable name. Then run:

``` make all ```

If there are any errors, fix them in your source code, and rerun the make command. Repeat until there are no errors. Then you can run your program:

``` ./executable_name ```


Upon successfully running the program, it should output: "All your tests have passed!" This indicates 
that all the SortedVector functionality works. If an assertion is triggered (and the program aborts), this 
indicates that a piece of functionality is incorrectly implemented. Find the source of the assertion and fix 
the bug in the relevant function's code.
